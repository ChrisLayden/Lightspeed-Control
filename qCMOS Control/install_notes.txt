Some notes
--------------------------------
1. At present, the camera is recognized only via USB3. Still working on connecting via CoaXpress.
2. Since a GPS card is not installed yet on the main control PC, I commented out "import GPS_time"
from GUI.py and test.py, as it was raising an error for not being able to find libmbgdevio.so
